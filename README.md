# My process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Constraint validation API

## What I learned

With this project, I was able to put in practice my CSS reponsive design skills. I also worked with the Contraint Validation API to make the form validation, adding a customized "bubble" message to display error message feedback to the user.

## Continued development

I'd like to keep practicing the usage of Contraint Validation API in future projects, I think it's very usefull to provide more complete and customized user experiences.
